# Solution walkthrough

 The source code of the solution is submited as a java and also as a txt file. The pdf contains explanations on the running time of the algorithm. I have also included the matlab code to generate the plots of the runtimes for different values of k which are submited as a jpg image. In the plots the x axis is the size of the array and the y axis is the time in seconds that the algorithm takes.
