# Solution Walkthrough
The pdf contains explanations of some of the codes, and some pseudocodes; one for counting in linear time how many of n integers of the range $[0,k]$ fall in the interval $[a,b]$. The algorithm must have pre-processing time of $\theta(n+k)$ to build auxiliary storage. In the end there is also a small algorithm to sort 2D points withing the unit circle based on their euclidean distance.
___
The LinearTimeSort.java implements algorithms for Counting sort, Bucket sort, and a linear time sort of n words of length k.
___
The Radix.java file contains an implementation of the radix sort starting with the most significant bit and propagates to the least significant bit.
I also cantains the code for an algorithm that sorts n integers in the range $n^3-1$ in linear time
