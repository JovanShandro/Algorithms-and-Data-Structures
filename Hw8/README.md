# Solution Walkthrough

The pdf first draws and explains the red-black trees that result after inserting the values 13, 44, 37, 7, 22, 16 successively into an empty red-black tree.
Below it shows drawings of all possible valid red-black trees that store the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. In the end there is a proof by induction that if the nr of nodes of the tree is > 0, than the tree has at least one red node.
___
The Rbtree.cpp and Rbtree.h containg the implementation of a red-black tree. The file rbt.cpp is for testing the tree.
