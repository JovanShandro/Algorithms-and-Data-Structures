# Solution walkthrough

Problem 1 requires us to implement 4 algorithms for finding the fibonacci numbers to check which is faster. In the folder I have also included a plot of the runtimes of each algorithm, and I have also put all the results in a table in the pdf file. The implementation is done in python.
Problem 2 wants us to come up with and implement an algorithm of fast multiplication for numburs so big that they can't be implemented as numerical values but as strings of binary numbers. The implementation is done in c++.
