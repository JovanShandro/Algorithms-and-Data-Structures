# Solution walkthrough

This folder contains a pdf which has all the parts of the homework
that have to do with writing (proofs on questions with asymptotic notations, big O, $\Theta$ and $\Omega$). The photo contains the scatter plots for the average, best, and worst cases considering the runtime of the algorithm. The implementation of the sorting algorithm is included both in java and in txt files. I have also included the matlab code to generate the plots. In the plots the x axis is the size of the array and the y axis is the time in seconds that the algorithm takes.
