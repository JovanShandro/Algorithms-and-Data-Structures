# Solution Walkthrough

Stack.h has the implementation of a stack in c++, and Queue.h is the implementation of a queue using 2 stacks.
___
The LinkedList_reverse.cpp implements an in-situ algorithm for reversing a linked list of n elements in linear time. The explanation is in the pdf.
___
The Bst_and_list.cpp is the implementation of a linked list and a binary search tree in c++. There is also an implementation of an algorithm that converts a binary search tree to a sorted linked list and in the pdf you can find the derivation of the asymptotic time complexity. Also in the main function there is an implementation of an algorithm that turns a sorted linked list to a binary search tree.
